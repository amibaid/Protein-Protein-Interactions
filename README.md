### Description
This is my summer project from UCSF AI4ALL! This project uses a support vector machine to predict protein-protein interactions between the human proteome and the SARS-CoV2 virus proteins using previously known virus-human protein interaction information between human and Zika virus proteins and sequence alignment.
